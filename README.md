## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

1. When your coding logic flow is not sequential. Even chatGPT fit no save you. Lols. Write clean code, and do so in order. First actions written first etc.   

### Continued development

More Next.js projects. GraphQL projects too in the longer term.

### Useful resources

Stackoverflow  
YouTube  
Google  
ChatGPT
